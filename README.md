# Advent of Code 2024

My advent of code completion in 2024.

## Objectives

- Complete all 25 days of the advent of code.
- Use a Rusty approach with extensive use of iterators and functional programming unless it affects readability in some instances.
- Use only the standard library and [itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools).

## Environment Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your `SESSION`cookie from the advent of code website.

## Usage

To run different days, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin <day>
```

For example, for day 1:

```bash
cargo run --bin 1
```
